Reagents & Equipment
----------------------------

* Colorimeter 
* Cuvettes with caps (preferably semi-macro cuvettes)
* Sulfanilamide, Sigma Cat # S9251-100G
* 3M HCl, Carolina Cat # 867861
* NED (N-1-napthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride), Sigma Cat # 33461-5G
* 1 mL and 100 uL variable pipettes
* 2 x small amber storage bottles
* Analytical balance
* Distilled water

Colorimeter set-up
------------------------

* Wavelength: 528 nm. Green led (colorimeter RGB board) 
* Nitrite standard data: 0 - 2.0 ppm NO\ :sub:`2`\  range. Download a data file or prepare your own nitrite standard data
* Before measuring a sample, blank the colorimeter against water or a distilled water sample developed with Greiss reagents as described below


Method
---------

Step 1: Prepare fresh reagents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**1% Sulfanilamide solution** 

* Weigh out 0.15g of sulfanilamide into a small amber bottle.   
* Add 15mL of 3M HCl.
* Shake to mix.

**0.02% NED solution** 

* Weigh out 2 mg (0.02 g) of NED into an amber bottle. 
* Add 100 mL of distilled water. 
* Shake to mix.

Step 2: Colorimetric assay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Transfer 1 mL of each sample to be tested into a cuvette
* Add 50 µL of 1% sulfanilamide reagent, cap cuvette and invert several times to mix
* Add 50 µL of 0.02% NED, cap cuvette and invert several times to mix
* Let tubes stand for 5-10 mins to develop color.
* Place the cuvette in the colorimeter and click measure. The program will return the nitrite concentration in ppm.
